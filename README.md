# All-O-one-Data-Structure
Challenge at LeetCode.com. Tags: Hash Table, Linked List, Sorting, Design.

Solutions with Custom-made Linked List: Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, C++, C#, Kotlin, Go.
Maintaining the frequencies in sorted order is accomplished through a custom-made linked list.Each insertion and deletion preserve the sorted order.


Solutions with TreeMap: Java, C++, Kotlin. Maintaining the frequencies in sorted order is accomplished through a tree map.
This solution is implemented in these three languages because they have an inbuilt map with ordering of the keysbased on a tree set. In Java and Kotlin it is the generic class TreeMap and C++ it is the template class map.
